# Measurement Free Error Correction

Traditional Quantum Error Correction requires measurment and feed back into
quantum circuit. Due to foundational limitation, they are costly timewise.
Decoherence could well happen. We present a time-ordered development of
measurement free error correction.


## First of Measurement Free Shcemes

The first will probably be from NMR system since they are the earliest platform
that implemented 



The earlest mention of measurement free scheme was in [^2]. But he did not give
any reference to paper. In this paper he was considering the effect of slow and
fast measurement on error correction threshold.

The second paper that I have seen which mentions the measurement-free error
correction was in [^3].

# Experimental Realizations


[^1] is an experimental paper that realizes measurement-free quantum error
correction on trapped ions. Provided shit reference, inaccurate.
