# PTM approach

PTM approach is a method to estimate thresholds for code concatenation. If the physical error rate is below this threshold, we can reduce the logical error rate to any desired value by concatenation. And the threshold to topological QEC code is the threshold that we can reduce the logical error rate by a larger code.
