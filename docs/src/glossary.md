# Measurement-Free Quantum Error Correction and Synonyms
- Error correction with quantum-feedback
- Coherent error correction

## Randomized Benchmarking
"average gate infidelity r(D) due to a noise process D can be accessed
 experimentally via randomized benchmarking" [^zhao]

## Diamond Distance
Analytic tool for obtaining an estimation of noise threshold.

While on the other hand, the error thresholds are usually obtain using rigorous
bounds via the diamond distance D(D)

For noise process $\mathcal{D}$ of different nature, "The diamond distance
scales as D(D) ∝ r(D) for stochastic Pauli noise, but scales differently as
D(D) ∝ √r(D) for the coherent noise". [^zhao]

## Sufrace Code
"(i) qubits are disposed in a planar array, only requiring local measurement
operations; and (ii) early estimates based on stochastic error models indicated
a very large threshold value, pc ≈ 11% [4], for the single-qubit error
probability p. For p < pc, the probability of successful encoding tends to 1 as
the number of physical qubits is increased." : Fidelity threshold of the surface
code beyond single-qubit error models

## Coherent error source
"systematic control noise, cross-talk, global external fields, and unwanted
qubit–qubit interactions" Greenbaum

## Topological code
A code whose codewords form the ground-state or low-energy subspace of a
(typically geometrically local) code Hamiltonian realizing a topological phase.
A topological phase may be bosonic or fermionic, i.e., constructed out of
underlying subsystems whose operators commute or anti-commute with each other,
respectively. Unless otherwise noted, the phases discussed are bosonic.
