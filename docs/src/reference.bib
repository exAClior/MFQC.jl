abstract = {An error correction algorithm is applied multiple times to a small quantum system. The computational potential of a quantum processor can only be unleashed if errors during a quantum computation can be controlled and corrected for. Quantum error correction works if imperfections of quantum gate operations and measurements are below a certain threshold and corrections can be applied repeatedly. We implement multiple quantum error correction cycles for phase-flip errors on qubits encoded with trapped ions. Errors are corrected by a quantum-feedback algorithm using high-fidelity gate operations and a reset technique for the auxiliary qubits. Up to three consecutive correction cycles are realized, and the behavior of the algorithm for different noise environments is analyzed.}}

abstract = {In ensemble (or bulk) quantum computation, all computations are performed on an ensemble of computers rather than on a single computer. Measurements of qubits in an individual computer cannot be performed; instead, only expectation values (over the complete ensemble of computers) can be measured. As a result of this limitation on the model of computation, many algorithms cannot be processed directly on such computers, and must be modified. We provide modification of the fault tolerant quantum computation protocols to enable processing on ensemble quantum computers.},

abstract={This dissertation investigates problems concerning decoherence and error correction in quantum computer architectures. First we discuss Evanescent-Wave Johnson Noise as a decoherence mechanism. A classical analogy between the Green's functions relevant to describing this noise is used in order to simplify calculations and present results focusing on geometries relevant for small devices. We apply this to model qubit decoherence in the presence of EWJN showing that it could be the dominant noise mechanism for spin qubits in magnetic fields around 1T. We then turn our attention to characterizing spatial noise correlations in existing qubit devices and strategies to optimize circuit design using correlation information. The concept can be viewed as a Ramsey experiment conducted in a two-dimensional product qubit subspace, allowing us to use many single qubit noise spectroscopy techniques to measure spatial correlations. This is a generalization of decoherence-free subspaces, which have been studied substantially as passive error correction. Next, we describe how to use knowledge of the correlations to choose the best circuit out of many candidates for doing a particular task. The proposed metrics produce predictions on which circuit will result in the highest fidelity under a given noise model, which we verify using numerical simulations. We demonstrate that a known procedure for coherent-error correction can be made fault tolerant by insisting that C_kNOT gates occur in a single time step. Justification for the simulation of these gates via classical ancillas combined with the Gottesman-Knill theorem is presented by proving that the ancilla and data registers are separable before correction operations. We produce a threshold for an example code on the same order of magnitude as previous work, but with a refined implementation that is fault tolerant. We continue with the use of redundant syndrome extraction in stabilizer codes to circumvent majority-rules decision making for conditional operations. We produce simulations comparing the two schemes across a range of models characterized by the independent error rates on qubits and measurements. The most robust realization of this scheme for several codes resemble balanced incomplete block designs, and we explore this correspondence towards generating new codes from designs.},
