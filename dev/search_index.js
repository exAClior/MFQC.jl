Noise can be broken down into two categories, incoherent noise coherent noise. Incoherent noise is stochastic while coherent noise is unitary. Amplitude damping, depolarizing, and phase damping are all examples of incoherent noise. Imperfect control in qubit gate implementation is an example of coherent noise. Quantum circuit with depolarizing noise can be efficiently simulated thanks to Gottesman-Knill Theorem. Therefore the nosie threshold is best understood in this regime. The study of the other noise faces the challange of exponentially increasing simulation cost.
